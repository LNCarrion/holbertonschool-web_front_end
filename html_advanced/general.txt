1. **Guidelines for HTML:**
   - Use lowercase tags: `<html>`, `<body>`, `<div>`.
   - Always include an `alt` attribute for images.
   - Use indentation and comments for readability.
   - Use semantic HTML tags for better structure.

2. **Creating the skeleton of an HTML5 page:**

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Page Title</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <header>
           <h1>Header</h1>
       </header>
       <main>
           <article>
               <h2>Article</h2>
               <p>Article content goes here.</p>
           </article>
           <aside>
               <h3>Aside</h3>
               <p>Additional content goes here.</p>
           </aside>
       </main>
       <footer>
           <h4>Footer</h4>
       </footer>
   </body>
   </html>


3. **Using semantic HTML tags:**
   - `<header>`: Represents a group of introductory or navigational aids.
   - `<main>`: Represents the main content of the document.
   - `<footer>`: Represents a footer for the section it appears in.
   - `<article>`: Represents a self-contained composition that can be independently distributable or reusable.
   - `<nav>`: Represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page.

4. **Use cases for `<div>` vs `<span>`:**
   - Use `<div>` for block-level elements that need to be grouped together.
   - Use `<span>` for inline elements that need to be styled or manipulated as a single unit.

5. **Semantic values of some HTML5 tags:**
   - `<header>`: Introduces a group of introductory or navigational aids.
   - `<main>`: Contains the central content unique to the document.
   - `<footer>`: Represents a footer for its nearest section or article element.
   - `<article>`: Represents a self-contained composition in a document.
   - `<nav>`: Represents a section of a page whose purpose is to provide navigation links.

6. **Using headings and hierarchical order:**
   - Use headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) to define the structure of your content.
   - Follow the hierarchical order (`<h1>` for main headings, `<h2>` for subheadings, etc.) for accessibility and SEO.

7. **Making lists in HTML:**
   - Ordered list: `<ol>` with `<li>` items.
   - Unordered list: `<ul>` with `<li>` items.
   - Definition list: `<dl>` with `<dt>` for terms and `<dd>` for definitions.

8. **Differences between media types (SVG, GIF, PNG, JPG):**
   - SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics, best for logos and icons as they can be scaled without losing quality.
   - GIF: Graphics Interchange Format, suitable for simple animations and images with a limited color palette.
   - PNG: Portable Network Graphics, ideal for images with transparency or sharp edges.
   - JPG: Joint Photographic Experts Group, best for photographs and complex images, but can lose quality with repeated editing and saving.

9. **Structuring data in a table:**
   - Use `<table>` for the table element.
   - Use `<tr>` for table rows.
   - Use `<th>` for table headers (optional but recommended).
   - Use `<td>` for table cells (data).

10. **Integrating a video in a webpage:**

    <video controls>
        <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>


11. **Integrating an audio file in a webpage:**

    <audio controls>
        <source src="music.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
        Your browser does not support the audio tag.
    </audio>


12. **Embedding external content:**
    - Use `<iframe>` for embedding external content like maps or videos.

    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"></iframe>


13. **Correctly structuring an HTML page:**
    - Use `<!DOCTYPE html>` to declare the document type.
    - Use `<html>` as the root element.
    - Use `<head>` to contain meta-information about the document.
    - Use `<body>` to contain the content of the document.
